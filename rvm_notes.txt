The (non-Git repository) Rubinius source downloads listed at http://rubini.us/downloads/ download faster than https://github.com/rubinius/rubinius.git. Is there any way I can direct rvm to use that source directory to install Rubinius after I have downloaded and uncompressed it?

cki
(Neither of those links seem to be broken.)
cki
Or is there any way to direct RVM where to download the source during rvm install rbx?
havenwood
cki: You can override the setting in ~/.rvm/config/db by creating ~/.rvm/config/user with your preferred setting for any line.
cki
havenwood: I'll try, thank you!
havenwood
cki: The https://github.com/rubinius/rubinius.git is for the git repo though. Like building from master.

cki: It looks like the binaries are already pointing at rubini.us.
cki
It looks to me (from RVM's output) like RVM downloads https://github.com/rubinius/rubinius.git during rvm install rbx

I think I'm using a version RVM doesn't have yet.
cki
Or...
cki
I don't know yet..

cki: With `rvm install rbx` I'm getting a quick binary download from https://rvm_io.global.ssl.fastly.net/binaries/...
havenwood
cki: What version of RVM are you on?
havenwood
Oh, actually, scratch that, the binary was the ruby prerequisite.
cki
rvm 1.26.11. I tried rvm install rbx-2.5.2. It said "No binary rubies available for: ubuntu/12.04/i386/rbx-2.5.2." But I guess it actually didn't download the Git repo because the Rubinius download size was only 11.1M. It took 24 seconds.
cki
So maybe I should just install the default rbx, not rbx-2.5.2. I'm not really attached to a particular version at this point.
havenwood
cki: You could try: rvm mount -r https://s3.amazonaws.com/releases.rubini.us/rubinius-2.5.2.tar.bz2 -n rbx-2.5.2
cki
Oh cool, I think that's what I was looking for! `rvm --help mount` says "RVM supports adding rubies compiled by user." so the specified directory might need to be the already compiled Ruby. That link is source. But I know how to build it now so that should work...
cki
I'm still testing, but thank you havenwood!
